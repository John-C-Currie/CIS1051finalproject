# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

derivativecalc

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A calculator that takes a function and converts it into its derivative.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will take in a user input, a fuction of some variable. Then that function will be iterated through and differentiated by parts by applying the differentiation rules. For rules that require multiple steps, a 'tempfunction' variable will be used to create a subfuction that is able to use simpler rules. Each time a part of the function is differentiated it will be added to another string assigned to a variable 'derivative' or something similar. Once the whole function has been differentiated the deriviative will be returned to the user.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not applicable.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will have an application that can differentiate simple functions that don't require multi-step rules to be applied.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will have an application that can differentiate any equation.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will have an application that can differentiate any equation and return values at specify 'x' values.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The project outline is fairly straight forward. All of the skills that I should need I have already acquired. The hardest part will be figuring out the implementation of the conversion function that will be determining which and how parts of the function will be differentiated. First I am going to create functions for all of the differentiation rules. Once those are complete I will start working on the conversion function. I will start out by focusing on simple functions that can be iterated from let to right without any issues. Once the conversion function is in the GOOD stage I will begin to work on a new version of the conversion fuction that implements a more complicated algorithm (assuming time permits). If I am able to complete that I will then implementate a calculate function that will take an input value and give an appropriate output of the derivative function.
