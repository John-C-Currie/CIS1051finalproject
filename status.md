Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created functions for each of the differentiation rules of functions. I have create a split function that will take a string and split into two lists, parts and signs. I have create a function that iterate through the parts function and create new list of derivative parts and then combine them with their respective signs to create the derivative of the original function.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to work with coeficient and sign changes to enable my simple conversion function to fully functional. Then I need to work out the more complicated version of the function to be able to differintiate any function.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

There is sometimes a weird out of bounds error that occurs, but changing the length of the inputed function seems to fix it (need to do some more case testing to debug the issue).
