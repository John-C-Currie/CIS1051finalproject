# Derivative Calculator

# This program is intended to take an input from the user in the form of a function, and to return an output that is the deriviative of that function

# Instructions: Use GUI.py file to run the program, use the entry box to input a function in the format of n(f(x))+/-n(f(x))... example: 2(x^2)-(sin(x))+12(ln(x))-(e^x). Then press the enter button for results

# Notes:
# The original plan for the calculator was to have it be able to differintiate ANY function. However processing complicated functions proved to be much more difficult than I had hoped for. 
# Instead the calculator can only differentiate functions that do not require the Product, Quotient or Chain rules (f(x)*g(x), f(x)/g(x), f(g(x))).
# Because I was not able to complete my original idea to its full extent I decided to add a simple GUI component to add some flare to the project
# It took a little while to find the right resources to implement my idea for the GUI but once I did it turned out to be fairly simple
# The project has a lot of room for improvement and features that I would like to add at some point, such as finding f'(n) and of course being able to accept any function as the input.
# I also had to set up some limitations to the user input to make the logic easier, but I would like to make it possible to input a function without parenthesises. 2x^2 instead of 2(x^2)
